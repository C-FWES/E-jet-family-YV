**A note on the -E2**

The Embraer E-Jet E2 series is a complete overhaul of the original E-Jet. The
version included in this pack is nowhere near the real thing; it is included
because it was there when I (tdammers) started working on it, but most of the
improvements made to the other models have not been ported to the E2. In its
current state, it should be considered "broken". Doing the E2 right would be a
gargantuan task, and I feel that doing it wrong isn't worth doing at all.

Hence, the E2 is provided "as-is"; it probably doesn't work at all, and if it
does, then it is almost guaranteed to be incorrect in all sorts of ways. If
anyone wants to step forward, feel free to send patches - but for the time
being at least, consider the E2 "highly experimental" at best.
